 Treehouse Project 5

Extra Credit Modifications:

1. Made the search bar dyanimc, the screen updates as you type! Yay!

2. Built a state abbreviator to make the addresses in the modal window look more like one would expect. Huzzah!

3. Modals now let you click between search results. Whoopy!

4. Made everything pastel, as it should be. Added box shadows to the cards to help the page feel less flat.
